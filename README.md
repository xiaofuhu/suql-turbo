# <font color="red">Use SUQL-turbo Library</font>

The setup process is similar to to SUQL's. To use SUQL-turbo, first set `PYTHONPATH` to the src folder
```
export PYTHONPATH=:path/to/suql-turbo/src
```
Then run embedding
```
cd path/to/suql-turbo/
python src/suql/experimental/embedding.py
```

# What is SUQL

SUQL stands for Structured and Unstructured Query Language. It augments SQL with several important free text primitives for a precise, succinct, and expressive representation. It can be used to build chatbots for relational data sources that contain both structured and unstructured information. Similar to how text-to-SQL has seen [great success](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql), SUQL can be used as the semantic parsing target language for hybrid databases, for instance, for:

![An example restaurant relational database](https://github.com/stanford-oval/suql/blob/main/figures/figure1.png?raw=true)

Several important features:

- SUQL seamlessly integrates retrieval models, LLMs, and traditional SQL to deliver a clean, effective interface for hybrid data access;
    - It utilizes techniques inherent to each component: retrieval model and LM for unstructured data and relational SQL for structured data;
- Index of free text fields built with [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), natively supporting all your favorite dense vector processing methods, e.g. product quantizer, HNSW, etc.;
- A series of important optimizations to minimize expensive LLM calls;
- Scalability to large databases with PostgreSQL;
- Support for general SQLs, e.g. JOINs, GROUP BYs.

## The answer function

One important component of SUQL is the `answer` function. `answer` function allows for constraints from free text to be easily combined with structured constraints. Here is one high-level example:

# Installation / Usage tutorial

There are two main ways of installing the SUQL library.

## Install from `pip`

Ideal for integrating the SUQL compiler in a larger codebase / system. See [install_pip.md](https://github.com/stanford-oval/suql/blob/main/docs/install_pip.md) for details.

## Install from source

Ideal for using this repo to build a SUQL-powered conversational interface to your data out-of-the-box, like the one for https://yelpbot.genie.stanford.edu discussed in the paper. See [install_source.md](https://github.com/stanford-oval/suql/blob/main/docs/install_source.md) for details.

## Agent tutorial

Check out [conv_agent.md](https://github.com/stanford-oval/suql/blob/main/docs/conv_agent.md) for more information on best practices for using SUQL to power your conversational agent.

# Release notes

    abstract = "While most conversational agents are grounded on either free-text or structured knowledge, many knowledge corpora consist of hybrid sources.This paper presents the first conversational agent that supports the full generality of hybrid data access for large knowledge corpora, through a language we developed called SUQL ($\textbf{S}$tructured and $\textbf{U}$nstructured $\textbf{Q}$uery $\textbf{L}$anguage). Specifically, SUQL extends SQL with free-text primitives (${\small \text{SUMMARY}}$ and ${\small \text{ANSWER}}$), so information retrieval can be composed with structured data accesses arbitrarily in a formal, succinct, precise, and interpretable notation. With SUQL, we propose the first semantic parser, an LLM with in-context learning, that can handle hybrid data sources.Our in-context learning-based approach, when applied to the HybridQA dataset, comes within 8.9{\%} Exact Match and 7.1{\%} F1 of the SOTA, which was trained on 62K data samples. More significantly, unlike previous approaches, our technique is applicable to large databases and free-text corpora. We introduce a dataset consisting of crowdsourced questions and conversations on Yelp, a large, real restaurant knowledge base with structured and unstructured data. We show that our few-shot conversational agent based on SUQL finds an entity satisfying all user requirements 90.3{\%} of the time, compared to 63.4{\%} for a baseline based on linearization.",
